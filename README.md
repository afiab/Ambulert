# Ambulert
## So that everyone gets there faster

Automobile traffic can be a big problem in urban areas, especially densely populated ones like Manhattan or South Asia for example. It can take an hour to go to another block in extreme cases. But car drivers aren't the biggest victims here; it's ambulances. It's already a hassle for ambulances on the streets of NYC to need to wait for cars to pull over before being able to pass via a certain road. However, peoples' lives depend on ambulances being able to get to their destination on time. 

### Explaining the SIte:

The website provides visuals of a proposed app solution to this problem. 

At the bottom of the site is an interactive game that acts as an example of how the app would work. The player uses the `ASDW` keys to control their car (the blue arrow), and avoid the ambulances (the red arrows). The game ends when the blue car crosses paths with an ambulance, and the game displays how many seconds the player lasted. Finally, the player has the option to restart the game with the `X` key.

### The Thought Process

I've been wanting to try out p5.js for some time, and I knew an ambulance alert system would help drivers drive safer and more efficiently. When trying to learn p5.js, I found a few pacman tutorials, which were the inspiration behind the game. The blue car is like pacman, who avoids the ghosts, which are the ambulances in this case.

## Please Note

Sometimes the p5.js window doesn't load correctly and it results in overlapping text. This should go away if the page is reloaded.
